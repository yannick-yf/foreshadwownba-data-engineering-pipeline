# MySQL set up
https://sebrave.medium.com/how-to-spin-up-a-local-mysql-database-on-macos-a550918f092b

Here’s how to quickly spin up a database for local development.

In the terminal, install MySQL using Homebrew:

brew install mysql

brew services start mysql

brew services list

Now in the terminal login using your root user:

mysql -u root -p

List existing databases and then create a new one:

SHOW DATABASES;

CREATE DATABASE mydatabase;

Make a user and assign them permissions:

CREATE USER ‘seb’@’localhost’ identified by ‘secret’;
GRANT ALL ON mydatabase.* TO ‘seb’@’localhost’;
exit;

And that’s it you’re good to go!

You can hook up your app to your local database for testing — MySQL runs on port 3306 by default.
